RFC4765

This is a Java library that implements much of the experimental data structure
of RFC4765 as a set of Java objects.

The Javadocs are fairly complete and are the best place to begin.

The library introduces a few new constants and definitions (generally named  X_ )
to work around ambiguities in the protocol as defined in the RFC, or to add
capabilities not already present. See the class Alert for examples of these.

The main message container classes are the subclasses of IDMEFMessage,
named IDMEFMessage_*. Instantiate one of those with the necessary
components and you've got an IDMEF message.

The structure of the Java classes follows the RFC, though the RFC specifies an
XML interchange format. A populated IDMEFMessage_* object is easily converted
to XML via XStream (http://xstream.codehaus.org/). 
Code to do this exists but is not yet included in this open source project,
but will be posted in due course. Bug the author if you need it now.
